<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention</em> to something in a line of text.<br>

Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.<br>

Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both</strong></em>.<br>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. <br>
Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br>
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.
<hr> 
<h2>Images </h2>
Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
